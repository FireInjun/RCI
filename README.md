# RCI Website Revamp

----
### The following information is my personal opinion as to how we can make it the most useful for you.


### NOTE: This is the first Iteration and generation of a site just so we can get SOMETHING up.

----
## Site facts:

* Your previous site was static ONLY and as such you were missing out on a lot of the younger customers.
	 `Static in this case means that it was only designed to be viewed on a desktop computer.`

* This NEW site is designed to be fully responsive and will have a different view for different devices.
	`This will allow us to reach a younger crowd than we traditionally have this is good and bad haha`

* I will be storing all of this and other relevant useful stuff on a repo here on GitHub at https://GitHub.com/fireinjun/RCI
