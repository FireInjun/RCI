# SITE BATTLEPLAN
----
## Purpose
A company's website is a VERY important aspect of its marketing and growth strategy in this day and age of constant digital communication and is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY in order to compete.

* There are shops in town with less skill and capacity getting more work because your site isn't up to par.

* When it boils down to it, your industry is in essence a glorified Graphic Design company, not having a good site can be devastating to your bottom line. If you can design shirts, why can't you make a site? That's how the younger generation will see it DESPITE the fact that they are in fact different jobs entirely. This site will fix that problem for you.

* A larger digital footprint is DIRECTLY related to more traffic. You cannot expect to scrape by on word of mouth anymore. While this site WILL 100% change the game for you, ideally to get the most out of it, we need to complement it with a Facebook page, take control of your Yelp account, and we will need to Optimize your site to the top of Google. That will take time, searches and content. We can automate the majority of that later to assist you.

## Domain Name
There are a plethora of names available for your usage. And there are just as many places to buy and set up everything.
For the sake of affordability and convenience I have laid out the following `Hacks` that we should do to get the most
out of everything. I am also including some important tips that should be taken into account should you decide to pull
the trigger and start this project.

### Tips:
* Hold your domain in a separate place from your host. This will give you a lot more flexibility in the future should you decide to change it up and try out a better or cheaper host as the prices are constantly fluctuating.
		* This also keeps the power in your hands should your host go under or try to charge you a fee to transfer.

* The free included email service that comes with your Host is almost always shit. Avoid it if possible. Email is the lifeblood of your business and you can't afford to depend on a cheap system. You need reliability and a proven system if you are going to be putting so much faith into it.

### Hacks:
Keeping in mind the above `Tips`, the following are my Hack recommendations for the best/cheapeast system for your situation.

#### Email and Domain
---
* Buy your domain from Google and use their GSUITE service for your email. 
	* This will not only give you a dependable, reliable company to hold your site ame, it also gives you the fastest DNS service in the world. This will make your site load faster and better than anyone else, it also makes it easy to find and sets you up for a simple Google Ads plan add-on in the future should you feel the need.
	* GSUITE offers several incredibly useful services for your company and is VERY affordable at only $15 a month for one email.
		* Having email through google makes checking it simple and setting it up a breeze on all devices. You can use and email client you want AND check it on gmail.com whenever you want.
		* The secondary and SUPER useful benefit for you, is the `UNLIMITED` google drive storage for all of your artwork back up (and any backup really) needs.
		* This is further beneficial to you because for your customers whom you have the most repeat business with, you can set up something called a `Team Drive` where they can upload their artwork and you can both access INSTANTLY, no more fighting with DropBox and searching.
		* An additional tertiary benefit of GSUITE is that you get to use the enterprise grade `Google FileStream` software. This basically makes your online "cloud drive" locally accessible as if it were a system drive. It's faster, easier to use and better in every way compared to DropBox

#### Hosting
* I have a way for you to spend $10 and have unlimited hosting for a whole year and then afterwards only spend $15 a month.

## Putting it all together:
By following my battle plan you will spend ONLY $15 a month for EVERYTHING for a year and have the ability to back up all of your data as well as access everything easier and faster. After one year it will go up to $30 a month and nothing is tied to your ISP or location. This will allow you to spend the remainder of your budget on advertising if we really want to get the most out of your site. I can guarantee a better uptime and an increase in productivity as well as an increase in business to the extent that you may not even be able to keep up with the work on your production side.
